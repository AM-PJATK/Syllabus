Remark

Mastering of parts of the lecture marked with the symbol (i) is not necessary - it is an extension of the basic Analysis course. However they may be very helpful in deeper understanding of the text and thus in solving the attached problems.


Goal of the course

The aim of this course is to review the basic notions and problems of mathematical analysis that are relevant for a well educated engineer.


Requirements

Discrete Mathematics and Linear Algebra.


Organization

The lectures are available in the electronic form by the internet PJWSTK educational system (EDU).
The text contains exercises with answers. However the student should try to solve these tasks by himself.
Each lecture contains a set of problems that must be solved by the student and submitted before indicated deadlines. The course consists of 15 lectures.
The consultant can be reached by e-mail or by discussion forum in the EDU system.
The consultant: Pawel Zabierowski.

Conditions

The student can earn from 0 up to 10 points for each set of problems. In order to obtain a positive grade (pass the semester) the student must collect 50% of maximal possible number of points (that is at least 75 points, because maximal number of points amounts 150).
The grades are 1,2,3,4 and 5.

Passing the semester is required for the final examination.

The lecture finishes with the written exam.
